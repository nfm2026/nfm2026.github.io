  # abstract: ""
  bio: "Tudor Achim is the CEO and Co-Founder of Harmonic, the AI lab building the world’s most advanced reasoning engine. 
    Under his leadership, Harmonic has pioneered the concept of Mathematical Superintelligence – the next generation of artificial intelligence 
    that eliminates hallucinations by reasoning through mathematics as opposed to language prediction – 
    and released the world’s first consumer-facing MSI model, Aristotle. 
    Aristotle recently achieved a gold medal-level performance at the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, 
    demonstrating problem-solving capabilities that exceed human benchmarks.
    Before founding Harmonic, Tudor co-founded and served as the CTO at Helm.ai, an autonomous driving software company. 
    Tudor holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and was a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Stanford. 
    He brings a rare combination of deep technical expertise and a vision to make mathematically grounded, 
    provably accurate AI broadly available to individuals and institutions worldwide."

  talk_title: "CSLib: Building a Platform for AI-assisted Formal Verification in Lean"  
  abstract: "I will explain the new CSLib initiative, with a focus on its code reasoning effort,
    which aims to build a new industrial-strength formal verification platform in
    Lean for verifying real-world code.  I'll describe the principles and design
    decisions behind the CSLib code reasoning effort.  I'll then illustrate it with
    an end-to-end example that brings together: AI-assisted code generation
    and code specification; the Boole language and the Strata framework for
    language-agnostic code reasoning; trustworthy verification condition
    generation;  and Lean automation through Lean-SMT and AI-assisted
    theorem proving."
  bio: "Clark Barrett is a Professor (Research) of Computer Science at Stanford
    University.  His expertise is in automated reasoning and its applications.  He
    was an early pioneer in satisfiability modulo theories, formal hardware
    verification, and neural network verification.  More recently, he has also
    pioneered efforts in AI-assisted formal verification.  He is the director of
    the Stanford Center for Automated Reasoning (Centaur), co-director of the
    Stanford Center for AI Safety, and a member of the CSLib steering committee.
    He is an ACM Fellow and a two-time winner of the Computer Aided Verification
    (CAV) award (2021, 2024)."

  talk_title: "Formal methods for robotics in the age of big data"
  abstract: "Robots are physical machines interacting with the real world; they are difficult to model, 
    yet we need to guarantee they will be safe. Making them even more difficult to verify is the growing 
    approach of using data, and generative AI, to control them. Given this, what role can, and should, 
    formal methods play in advancing robotics? In this talk I will give a few examples for what we can 
    do with formal methods to \"verify\" robot behavior, discuss their promise and challenges, and 
    describe the synergies I see with data-driven approaches."
  bio: "Hadas Kress-Gazit is the Geoffrey S.M. Hedrick Sr. Professor at the Sibley School of Mechanical 
    and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University, and the Associate Dean for Diversity and Academic 
    Affairs of Cornell Duffield College of Engineering. She received her Ph.D. in Electrical and Systems 
    Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 2008 and has been at Cornell since 2009. Her research 
    focuses on formal methods for robotics and automation and more specifically on high-level specifications 
    and synthesis for robot control. Her group has explored different types of robotic systems including 
    modular robots, soft robots and swarms, and how formal methods can be used for human-robot interaction. 
    She received an NSF CAREER award in 2010, a DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2012, Cornell Engineering’s 
    Excellence in teaching award in 2013 and 2019, and excellence in research award in 2021. She is an IEEE 
    Fellow and has served on DARPA’s Information Science and Technology study group (ISAT), as the program 
    chair for Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2018, the program chair for the International Conference 
    on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2022, and the president of the RSS board (2019-2023), among other 
    leadership positions in the robotics community."

  talk_title: "Lean 4: A Unified Platform for Programming and Verification"
  abstract: "Lean 4 is an open-source functional programming language and
    interactive theorem prover based on dependent type theory. Its
    powerful type system enables users to write programs and prove
    properties about them within a single unified framework. In this talk,
    I will present the key design decisions behind Lean 4, its extensible
    infrastructure, and recent developments in proof automation, including
    the grind tactic and our current efforts on scalable verification
    condition generation. I will also discuss Lean 4's growing adoption by
    AI research teams, which have used Lean as the backbone for recent
    breakthroughs in AI-assisted mathematics, and its expanding ecosystem
    of libraries and users in both mathematics and software verification."
