  bio: "
    Tudor Achim is the CEO and Co-Founder of Harmonic, the AI lab building the world’s most advanced reasoning engine. 
    Under his leadership, Harmonic has pioneered the concept of Mathematical Superintelligence – the next generation of artificial intelligence 
    that eliminates hallucinations by reasoning through mathematics as opposed to language prediction – 
    and released the world’s first consumer-facing MSI model, Aristotle. 
    Aristotle recently achieved a gold medal-level performance at the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, 
    demonstrating problem-solving capabilities that exceed human benchmarks.
    Before founding Harmonic, Tudor co-founded and served as the CTO at Helm.ai, an autonomous driving software company. 
    Tudor holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and was a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Stanford. 
    He brings a rare combination of deep technical expertise and a vision to make mathematically grounded, 
    provably accurate AI broadly available to individuals and institutions worldwide."

  bio: "Clark Barrett is a Professor (Research) of Computer Science at Stanford
    University.  His expertise is in automated reasoning and its applications.  He
    was an early pioneer in satisfiability modulo theories, formal hardware
    verification, and neural network verification.  More recently, he has also
    pioneered efforts in AI-assisted formal verification.  He is the director of
    the Stanford Center for Automated Reasoning (Centaur), co-director of the
    Stanford Center for AI Safety, and a member of the CSLib steering committee.
    He is an ACM Fellow and a two-time winner of the Computer Aided Verification
    (CAV) award (2021, 2024).

  talk_title: "CSLib: Building a Platform for AI-assisted Formal Verification in Lean"  
  abstract: "I will explain the new CSLib initiative, with a focus on its code reasoning effort,
    which aims to build a new industrial-strength formal verification platform in
    Lean for verifying real-world code.  I'll describe the principles and design
    decisions behind the CSLib code reasoning effort.  I'll then illustrate it with
    an end-to-end example that brings together: AI-assisted code generation
    and code specification; the Boole language and the Strata framework for
    language-agnostic code reasoning; trustworthy verification condition
    generation;  and Lean automation through Lean-SMT and AI-assisted
    theorem proving."

  bio: "Leo is a Senior Principal Applied Scientist in the Automated Reasoning Group at AWS. 
    In his spare time, he dedicates himself to serving as the Chief Architect of the Lean FRO, a non-profit organization 
    that he proudly co-founded alongside Sebastian Ullrich. He is also honored to hold a position on the Board of Directors 
    at the Lean FRO, where he actively contributes to its growth and development. Before joining AWS in 2023, he was a Senior 
    Principal Researcher in the RiSE group at Microsoft Research, where he worked for 17 years starting in 2006. 
    Prior to that, he worked as a Computer Scientist at SRI International. His research areas are automated reasoning, 
    theorem proving, decision procedures, SAT and SMT. He is the main architect of several automated reasoning tools: 
    Lean, Z3, Yices 1.0 and SAL. Leo's work in automated reasoning has been acknowledged with a series of prestigious awards, 
    including the CAV, Haifa, and Herbrand awards, as well as the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Software Award twice 
    for Z3 and Lean. Leo's work has also been reported in the New York Times and many popular science magazines such as Wired, 
    Quanta, Nature News, and Scientific American."
  talk_title: "Lean 4: A Unified Platform for Programming and Verification"
  abstract: "Lean 4 is an open-source functional programming language and
    interactive theorem prover based on dependent type theory. Its
    powerful type system enables users to write programs and prove
    properties about them within a single unified framework. In this talk,
    I will present the key design decisions behind Lean 4, its extensible
    infrastructure, and recent developments in proof automation, including
    the grind tactic and our current efforts on scalable verification
    condition generation. I will also discuss Lean 4's growing adoption by
    AI research teams, which have used Lean as the backbone for recent
    breakthroughs in AI-assisted mathematics, and its expanding ecosystem
    of libraries and users in both mathematics and software verification.
