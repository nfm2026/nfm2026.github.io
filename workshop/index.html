      <h2>Scope and Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        This workshop explores the intersection of <strong>formal requirements engineering</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>, addressing a central challenge in modern software and AI system development:
        how to precisely specify requirements for increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and autonomous systems, and how to verify and validate that such systems meet those requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       As AI technologies become deeply embedded in safety and mission-critical domains, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnostics, financial systems to industrial automation and space exploration, the need for rigorous, formal approaches to requirements is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, traditional requirements engineering methods face new challenges when applied to systems with learning-enabled components, unpredictable behaviors, and emergent properties. The opacity of AI models and the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level model inputs and internals create significant impediments to verifying and validating that such systems meet their specified requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
  The workshop welcomes extended abstract contributions on formal specification languages for AI systems, verification and validation techniques, requirements for trustworthy AI, case studies from real-world applications, and novel applications of AI to requirements engineering itself.  We aim to foster dialogue between communities that have traditionally worked separately, building bridges toward more reliable, safe, and trustworthy AI systems grounded in rigorous requirements practices. 
  Extended abstracts can summarize and cite results from recent published paper(s) and/or state your perspective.

      <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How can we formally specify requirements for systems with learning-enabled components?</li>
        <li>How can formal frameworks capture fairness, safety, robustness and explainability requirements for AI systems?</li>
        <li>How do we verify that AI systems meet their specified requirements?</li>
        <li>What role can AI play in automating requirements elicitation, formalization analysis, and validation?</li>
        <li>How do we bridge high-level requirements and behavior of AI-enabled systems to enable traceability, safety assurance, and certification?</li>
      </ul>
